        * Architectures (configure via `-notamd64` key): 
          * x64 ➟ x32
          
        * Priorities (configure via `-vsw-priority` and `-stable` keys). 
          Specific workload components in more priority than pre-release products. See Issue #8

               Also, do not search the light versions: New compiling will not generate this at all.
