    * NEW: Added `-vsw-priority` feature. Issue #8.
            ```
             -vsw-priority {IDs} - Non-strict components preference: C++ etc.
                                   Separated by space: https://aka.ms/vs/workloads
            ```
           
    * NEW: Added `-stable` key. To ignore possible beta releases in last attempts.
    
    * NEW: Additional `-reset-cache` key. To reset all cached vswhere versions before processing.
    
    * NEW: Optional aggressive behavior for `-vsw-priority`, `-notamd64` through `-force` key.
    
    * FIXED: Fixed receiving of remote vswhere version specified by default (when no `-vswhere-version`).
    
    * FIXED: Fixes usage of changed vswhere version specified via `-vswhere-version` when it was already cached.
    
    * CHANGED: Algorithm of searching:

        * Versions: 
          * VS2017+ ➟ VS2015, VS2013, ... ➟ .netfx
          
        * Architectures (configure via `-notamd64` key): 
          * x64 ➟ x32
          
        * Priorities (configure via `-vsw-priority` and `-stable` keys). 
          Specific workload components in more priority than pre-release products. See Issue #8

          1. Stable releases with selected workload components (C++ etc) ➟ Same via beta releases if allowed.
          2. Stable releases with any available components ➟ Same via beta releases if allowed.
          
    * CHANGED: Updated keys: `-no-vswhere`, `-no-vs`, `-no-netfx`, `-vsw-version`, `-no-cache`. 
               Old keys still are activated, but it will cause a warnings (stdout).
               
    * CHANGED: Optional `__p_call` flag if you plan to use the call-type to invoke hMSBuild inside your scripts etc.
               
    * CHANGED: Fully updated compression. Now only minified version will be distributed by default.
               Also, do not search the light versions: New compiling will not generate this at all.
