Compiled text-based embeddable pure batch-scripts (no powershell, no dotnet-cli) for searching of available MSBuild tools.

## Why hMSBuild ?

*because you need simple access to msbuild tools and more...* 

Based on **GetNuTool core** https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool

* Initially, it was part of this tool like a small msbuild-helper. Then, it has been extracted into the new project after major changes from MS for their products. Now we have more support of all this.

Today's [hMSBuild](https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild) provides flexible way to access to msbuild tools for any type of your projects. Just specify what you need in different environments. Look at *#Algorithm of searching* below.

### Features

Just a **single batch file** and no more for your happy build. 

Combine this with your other available scripts or just type `hMSBuild {arguments to original msbuild}` and have fun.

Start with `hMSBuild -h`

### What supports ?

* Versions from VS2019+, VS2017 
    * Full support even if you still have no any [local `vswhere.exe`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vswhere/issues/41) [[?](https://github.com/Microsoft/vswhere/issues/41)]
    
* Versions from VS2015, VS2013, VS2012
* Versions from .NET Framework, including for VS2010

### Algorithm of searching

**v2.0+**

* Versions: 
  * VS2019+, VS2017 âžŸ VS2015, VS2013, ... âžŸ .netfx
* Architectures (configure via `-notamd64` key): 
  * x64 âžŸ x32
* Priorities (configure via `-vsw-priority` and `-stable` keys). *Specific workload components in more priority than pre-release products. See [Issue #8](https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild/issues/8)*

  1. Stable releases with selected workload components (C++ etc) âžŸ Same via beta releases if allowed.
  1. Stable releases with any available components âžŸ Same via beta releases if allowed.

## Usage

Usage is same as it would be same for msbuild. But you also have an additional keys to configure hMSBuild and to access to GetNuTool.

## Integration with other scripts

### batch

hMSBuild is a pure batch script. Therefore, you can combine this even inside your other batch scripts. Or simply invoke this externally as you need:

~

```bat
set msbuild=hMSBuild -notamd64
...
%msbuild% Conari.sln /m:4 /t:Rebuild
```

```bat
for /F "tokens=*" %%i in ('hMSBuild -only-path -notamd64') do set msbuild="%%i"
...
%msbuild% /version
```

...


## Build & Tests

Our build was based on [vssbe](https://github.com/3F/vsSolutionBuildEvent) scripts. 

You don't need to do anything else, just navigate to root directory of this project, and:

```bat
.\build
```

Available tests can be raised by command:

```bat
.\tests
```

We're waiting for your awesome contributions!
